0,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
0,Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
0,@USAirways who do we voice our concerns to when we can't get home with our 8 month old after waiting to taxi to a gate for 3 hours?
0,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
0,"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."

0,@VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
0,@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!

0,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
0,"@JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!"

0,@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
0,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
0,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.

0,@SouthwestAir How do I stop getting credit card apps? I already have a card!
0,@USAirways 4 hours on hold to change a Cancelled Flightled flight. Completely unacceptable!!!
0,@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
0,@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
0,@united Can you transfer my bags too?
0,@USAirways I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting!

0,"@JetBlue well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats"

1,@USAirways Thank you for your help today.  I have been a loyal US airways customer and i appreciate your responding to my tweets.
0,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
0,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
1,@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)
0,"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
0,@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
0,"@JetBlue if u want to be helpful save me the trip from Westchester Cty to JFK, plus parking - my info is in the photo http://t.co/JI7xkS2jkk"
0,@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
0,"@JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever"
1,@USAirways yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan !
0,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool

0,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
0,@united you are terrible.
0,@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.
0,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
1,@united THANK YOU!
0,@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
0,@SouthwestAir Any plans to make the southwest app for Android not crappy?
0,@AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes
1,@JetBlue is amazing. Had a short delay. They gave me $150 credit! It was literally pretty much my fault I missed the flight.
0,"@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?"

0,"@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit."
0,@SouthwestAir the ball has been dropped. My snowboard will not be making it to my destination. #totalfail #letdown

0,"@JetBlue I'm disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song ""I'm Blue"" while flying on JetBlue."
0,@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!

0,"@SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again"
0,@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
0,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
0,@SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job.
0,@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
1,@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
0,"@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available"

0,@SouthwestAir @Matt_e_Boss how long did you have to hold? We waited 35 minutes and gave up
0,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?

0,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
0,@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me

0,"@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!"
0,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!

0,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"

0,@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
0,@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
0,@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
0,@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
0,@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
0,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.

0,@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
0,@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
0,"@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning."
1,@SouthwestAir I'm on the 10:55 flight! Everyone has been so nice and helpful! I'm just hoping we'll get to fly out! Thank you! ;)
0,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
1,@AmericanAir exceptional customer service from AA - my misplaced item was waiting for me at checkin followed by a smooth flight. Thank you!
0,@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss

1,@JetBlue Thanks for the reminder of a few older flights I'd taken and the easy access to add points to my new JB account! Awesome service.
0,@USAirways nothing like back to back delayed flights let hope this one isn't 12 hours like the last time.
0,"@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!"

0,@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
0,@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
0,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
0,"@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"

0,"@JetBlue No, he didn't have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep?"

0,@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
0,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.

0,"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."

0,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"

0,@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
0,@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax

0,@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
0,@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
0,@USAirways I'm tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service @AmericanAir. #notafanofyourmerger

1,@SouthwestAir thanks for an awesome flight and connection! We were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing!
0,@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
1,@VirginAmerica Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
0,@VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline?
0,"@USAirways ur ""response"" was: my ""inconvenience was of no matter."" U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair"
0,@AmericanAir trying to get thru to agent since last night b/c AA changed our flight to 2 days from now. Infuriating! We need to get to SEA!
0,@SouthwestAir On hold for two hours and it timed-out on me. Great system you got there.
0,"@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day."
0,"@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps."
0,@AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down
0,@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
1,@USAirways Absolutely!! The staff was amazing!!
0,@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
0,"@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!"
0,@SouthwestAir doesn't even have gluten free peanuts. whyyy me??
0,"@USAirways his name is Rett Cavan, he has a gofundme page, and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money"
0,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
0,@AmericanAir cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow.
1,@AmericanAir my boss is :)
0,@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
0,@JetBlue @martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
1,@VirginAmerica good to be home #texas #moodlighting http://t.co/N3BVZTY3zI
0,@SouthwestAir I start a new job tomorrow &amp; you Cancelled Flight my flight (1629 BWI-LAX) and you really can't get me on another flight today ?!

1,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
0,@USAirways your airline also delayed our bags to us for 4 hours &amp; refused to ship them to our local airport #disappointed #stillbagless
0,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
0,@USAirways @nburnside26 Well if you really didn't like them then she would be on an airplane. #FIOUSAirways üíÅ
0,@JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue
0,@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
0,@AmericanAir But Eagle is always Late Flight
0,@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
0,@united She üëè won't üëè be üëè at üëè my üëè wedding üëè. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
0,@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
0,@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.
0,@AmericanAir Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW
0,"‚Äú@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT‚Äù A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
0,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
1,@JetBlue you got yourselves hot ladies flying the air for life #loyal
0,@SouthwestAir I'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat.
0,"@AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now."
1,@VirginAmerica plus you've added commercials to the experience... tacky.
0,"@AmericanAir Its the ABC's of PR, let your customers have the most info possible. Might want to go brush up on the basics..."
0,@VirginAmerica sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns!
0,@USAirways Collectively since Friday I've been on hold with customer service for over 3 hrs. My issue is not resolved... so frustrated!
0,@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
0,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
0,@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat

0,"@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted"
0,"@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous."
0,@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to EWR. Flt 3076. U also Cancelled Flightled flights to LGA. Yet @united is flying on time to both. WTH??
0,@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain

0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir pissing off thousands of East coast customers.  When the delay is longer than the flight,  you = fail"
0,@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
0,"@AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear"
0,"@JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers!"
0,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
1,"@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)"
0,"@AmericanAir my itinerary was from EWR TO DALLAS to LA. You Cancelled Flightled my flight, you have my money, find a way to get me there from EWR"
1,"@VirginAmerica @freddieawards Done and done! Best airline around, hands down!"
0,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
0,@SouthwestAir I'm trying to change a family vacation due to Measles outbreak and haven't been able to get anyone on the phone. Any help?
0,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"

0,"@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking."
0,@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
0,@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl
0,@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
0,@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
0,"@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care."
1,@JetBlue Aw okay thanks

0,@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
0,@USAirways From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue?

1,@AmericanAir I love your company and your staff is amazing. They just made an uncomfortable situation comfortable

Austin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really?"
0,.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.

0,"@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW."

1,"@JetBlue be flying soon to NYC on your airline, of all airlines I've flown you're still #1 to me üòäüòäüòä‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è"

0,STOP THIS ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Ac6zwmuOOn‚Äù
1,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
0,"@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed."
0,@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
0,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
0,@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
0,@SouthwestAir after a long wait of over an hour my mother's bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help
0,@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
0,@SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help
0,"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."
1,@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
0,"@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves."
0,@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
0,@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
0,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
0,@VirginAmerica @VirginAtlantic I have just checked in flight to SFO from LAX &amp; been told as Atlantic Flying Club Gold I get no benefits?!
0,@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
0,@AmericanAir My flight 1389 from Las Vegas to DFW was Cancelled Flightled! I've been on hold forever and I still have not spoken to anyone! Pls Help
0,@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
0,@USAirways we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. I'll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv
0,@SouthwestAir now I can't board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I've been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday
1,@USAirways Can't wait for the trip. Thanks for getting me there!
0,"@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice"
0,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
1,@AmericanAir thanks
0,@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
1,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
0,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
0,@SouthwestAir so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?
0,@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
0,"‚Äú@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.‚Äù Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!"
0,"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
0,@SouthwestAir 9 hours at this airport and you can't move a bag from one plane to another! #furious
0,"@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it..."
0,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
0,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
0,@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
0,@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
0,@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
0,"@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?"
1,@SouthwestAir thank you for the confirmation. Maybe people on my flight have directional dislexia.
0,@JetBlue still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago.
0,"@JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line.
Please see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance."
0,@united you're terrible.
1,@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
0,@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
1,@SouthwestAir finally got through. Thanks!
1,@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights
0,@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
0,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
0,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
0,"@AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to ""weather"", while other flights were still landing at DFW"
1,@JetBlue you all are the best #flyfi # ondemand #leatherseats #hipunis #legroom
0,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
0,@SouthwestAir so u Cancelled Flight our flight to PHX bc of SDF weather but flights 2 the NE from SDF are still going on?! WTF? http://t.co/NGG3N0wIaR
0,"@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff"

1,@JetBlue sooo earlier i said i couldnt fly with you for my school trip but now i can! üòè
0,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
0,@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
0,@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
0,@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
0,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
1,@JetBlue Mark T.  in Austin was great handling my bag issue.  #thanks
0,@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
0,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
0,@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
0,@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!

1,@United I'd like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight

1,@AmericanAir thank you for responding rather quickly btw
1,@SouthwestAir El Paso deals....May‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòçüåè
0,@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
0,@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
0,@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.

1,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
0,"@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt."
0,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
0,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
1,"@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?"
0,@AmericanAir really
0,@SouthwestAir I am trying to change a ticket for travel on Monday that cannot be changed online. Anyway faster than waiting on hold? #anhour

0,@USAirways - been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS!
0,@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
0,"@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse."
0,@USAirways And the lies continue. Just waited another hr to get boarding passes for flight supposedly created today which is now Cancelled Flightled?!
1,".@JetBlue Wish you would make Austin, TX a hub. Missing you as my ‚Äúonly‚Äù airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :("
0,@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
0,@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
0,@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
0,"@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion"
1,"@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate."

0,"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
0,@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
0,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
0,@SouthwestAir what do I need to do when TSA pre doesn't show for a flight of mine?
0,"@united I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit"

0,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
0,@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!

0,@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
0,@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
